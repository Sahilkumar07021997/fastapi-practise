"""
FastApi Theory:
-> FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+
    based on standard Python type hints.
-> It is designed to be easy to use and to help developers create robust and efficient web applications quickly.
-> It is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.
-> FastAPI is known for its high performance, which is comparable to Node.js and Go,
    making it one of the fastest Python web frameworks available.
-> FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation
    (using Swagger UI and ReDoc) based on the defined endpoints and data models.
-> It supports asynchronous programming, allowing developers to write non-blocking
    code using async and await keywords.
-> FastAPI has built-in support for data validation and serialization using Pydantic models.
